Portuguese midfielder Simao Sabrosa converted from the penalty spot in the 90th minute while Argentine forward Nicolas Leandro Velez put the game beyond Chennaiyin's reach in the injury time (90+5) to hand NorthEast United their first points in the season at their home ground.
The match, which saw one red and 10 yellow cards being shown by the referee, witnessed many heated moments, with the players almost exchanging blows at times. Chennaiyin played with 10 men from the 40th minute onwards after Harmanjot Khabra was given a straight red card by the referee for violent conduct.
Before the half time, NorthEast head coach Cesar Farias and his Chennaiyin counterpart Marco Materazzi exchanged heated words from their respective touchlines. This brought players and officials from both sides face-to-face and on the verge of exchanging blows and the match was interrupted for about five minutes.The visiting team's captain Bernard Mendy chased Farias and he had to be stopped physically by other players and the referee.
After the referee blew the final whistle, Mendy again chased Farias and this time the players of both the sides were involved in a scuffle. The referee had to intervene and security officials prevented the situation from worsening further in front of the nearly 20,000 crowd at the Indira Gandhi Stadium.
In the 77th minute, NorthEast United's Sabrosa and Chennaiyin's Mehrajuddin Wadoo got involved in a face-off and both were shown the yellow cards.
In the first half, NorthEast got ample chances but failed to convert them into goals.

<h2 style="color:red;">Effect of Dengue Minimal in Northeast India, Say Experts</h2>
<center><img src="G:\ \Project2\fly.jpg" alt="milz" width="400px" height="400px"></center>
AGARTALA:  Though the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which causes dengue, is found in abundance in the northeastern states, the deaths due to the disease are fortunately very minimal in the region, experts said in Agartala today."During a recent official survey, it was found that in the urban and semi-urban areas of the northeastern states, the Aedes aegypti mosquito was found in abundant. However, the toll due to dengue is negligible in the northeastern states," Tripura health department official Pranab Chatterjee told reporters.He said: "Due to people's alertness and health personnel's seriousness, the death due to dengue is insignificant in the northeastern region."In the presence of Tripura Health Minister Badal Choudhury, Mr Chatterjee said so far 15 people have been affected by dengue in the state, but none of them has died so far."Dengue is an infection disease caused by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which is the primary epidemic vector. Dengue infection may occur in the form of classical dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever with bleeding manifestations or with or without shock (decreased blood pressure), and then the patient might expire in that situation," he added.To check the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in Tripura, last year the state government with the advice of the union health and family welfare ministry targeted to administer JE vaccine to 513,800 children up to the age of 15 years. But due to negative campaign by a section of media, only 226,500 JE vaccines could be given, the Health Minister said.The Minister said last year around 51,300 people, mostly children, fell ill to malaria and of them around 100 people died. This year so far, 22,562 people have suffered from malaria and 16 people have succumbed to the disease.

'Train Services to Start Any Time on Assam Broad Gauge Line': Tripura Transport Minister
AGARTALA:  Regular train services would start any time on the newly-laid broad gauge track from Lumding to Silchar in Assam that would provide better connectivity in the mountainous north-eastern region, Tripura Transport Minister Manik Dey said today.
Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu accompanied by senior officials held a meeting with Dey, who also holds the power portfolio, on Wednesday in New Delhi and discussed various railway projects in the north-eastern region.
"The regular train services on the Lumding-Silchar broad gauge line would start any time. Some technical aspects are being checked up and after that the vital railway line would become operational," Dey told reporters here.
To bring the section in sync with those in the rest of the country, the railways in phase one earlier this year successfully converted the 115- to 120-year-old metre gauge line to broad gauge line that cost around Rs.5,500 crore.
The 210-kilometre-long Lumding-Silchar railway line consists of 21 tunnels (the longest one being 3.23 km long), 79 major bridges and 340 minor bridges, 28 stations and four halt stations.
In the second phase, the Northeast Frontier Railway from Sunday started work to convert the Badarpur-Kumarghat-Agartala section (excluding Badarpur railway station in southern Assam) from metre gauge to broad gauge.
Running of both passenger and goods trains between Badarpur and Agartala section was stopped on September 19. The gauge conversion work would be complete by March 2016."We urged the railway minister to ensure the gauge conversion work be completed on time as it is a national project and Tripura depends on it for supplies of essentials, transport fuel and other vital goods from other bigger states," Mr Dey added.
The Tripura minister requested the railway minister to construct at least 14 overbridge, 13 under-bridges and six level crossings on the Badarpur and Agartala section so that running of high-speed trains remains unhindered.Prabhu on the invitation of the Tripura minister has agreed to visit Tripura during the second week of October to supervise the project.The Lumding-Silchar-Agartala gauge conversion project was sanctioned in 1996-97 when H.D. Deve Gowda was the prime minister.It was declared a national project in 2004, ensuring uninterrupted funding from the general budget.
The Lumding-Silchar-Agartala railway line is considered to be the lifeline for Assam, Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur.

<h2 style="color:red;"> How Special Forces Took Out Terror Camp in Myanmar</h2>
<center><img src="G:\ \Project2\attack.jpg" alt="milz" width="400px" height="400px"></center>

In June ambush, insurgents in Manipur killed 18 soldiers.
NEW DELHI:  For hours, the team of more than 20 Indian soldiers waited, in territory belonging to another country.
Their orders - to engage and destroy camps just across the border with Myanmar set up by the insurgent National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang).
The details of how a small group of highly-trained commandos from the Indian Army located and killed separatist rebels fighting for secession have been kept largely classified so far. NDTV has now accessed how the operation unfolded on June 9.  
Commandos from the 21 Special Forces battalion, highly skilled in covert and jungle warfare operations in the Northeast, observed enemy movement, and picked their targets carefully. They had entered the thickly forested area by 11 pm on June 8, crossing into Myanmar on foot.
By 4:45 am on June 9, not too long before sunrise, it was time to strike.The man in charge of this covert squad was a young Lieutenant Colonel (names cannot be revealed for security reasons). He would lead from the front. Next in line, a paratrooper he described as his "buddy", a havildar or senior jawan and another paratrooper from the havildar's team.
All four men had trained for years in fighting in the thick jungles of the northeast in oppressive heat and humidity. They were among the finest the Indian Army could have picked for such an operation - experienced, motivated and exceptionally skilled in the dark craft of killing enemies of the state, if necessary, behind enemy lines.18 soldiers had been killed by the insurgents in the preceding week. The government was determined to prove its resolve to combat terrorism, even if that meant a stealth operation in another country.The Lieutenant Colonel had selected two targets. The havildar and his paratrooper would engage the first sentry post, a short distance away. The senior officer would personally lead the attack on the second sentry post with his buddy.
The insurgents were active at the post of one of the training camps they run in this area. Their sentries were alert. But blending into the jungle in the darkness of the night, the havildar and his paratrooper, who were handpicked for the operation, crawled towards the sentry post. The latter scanned the area for insurgents, as the havildar sneaked under a gun position manned by a terrorist in a sentry post. The terrorist's machine gun poking out of a loophole in the post was pointed not too far away from him. Acting instantly and decisively, the havildar stuck his silenced Uzi sub-machine gun through the loophole and shot the man with the machine gun.He then shot another insurgent in the head, killed a third at point blank range. The entire engagement lasted less than a minute.
 And quickly and quietly as they came, the two blended into the foliage and radioed their Commanding Officer, the Lieutenant Colonel, of their success in neutralising three NSCN (K) terrorists. And then they waited. And observed.A short distance away, the Lieutenant Colonel and his paratrooper buddy made their way to the second post, employing years of high-intensity training in jungle conditions to move without making a sound.Using his weapon, another Uzi sub-machine gun fitted with a silencer to mute the sound of the gunshots, the Lieutenant Colonel shot dead two insurgents in the second post and quickly exited the post only to spot an enemy bunker no more than 30 metres from his position. Upon hearing sounds in this bunker, the Lieutenant Colonel lobbed a grenade then moved inside. But if the Colonel thought all the terrorists had been eliminated inside with the grenade he had lobbed, he was wrong. Stunned, injured, but alive, terrorists inside the bunker tried to respond to the attack only to fall to the bullets of the Lt. Colonel's Uzi. Four insurgents were killed.Escaping to a position a short distance away, the Colonel ordered a group of Indian para-commandos, located nearby, to launch an attack on the terrorist camps using heavy firepower. On his instruction, 21 Special Forces commandos opened up with rocket-propelled grenades and obliterated their targets over 20 minutes. Also coordinating the fire and giving locations on his radio was the Havaldar who had attacked the first insurgent post.By now, the entire terrorist camp which the commandos had attacked was alerted to the Indian presence and opened fire from 10-12 bunkers in the area. But the overwhelming firepower of the Indian Army's rocket-propelled grenades obliterated the target as the four commandos who had personally engaged the terrorists escaped to Indian lines with the entire squad of Indian Special Forces following them into home territory.The young Lieutenant Colonel, already a Shaurya Shakra winner, has been awarded a Kirti Chakra for valour, the second highest peacetime decoration for valour. And the Havildar leading the attack on the first enemy post has been honoured with the Shaurya Chakra, the third highest peacetime decoration for valour.

Assam Flood Kill 4, Over 2,000 Villages Still Under Water.
About 1.45 lakh hectares of agricultural land is under flood waters.
GUWAHATI:  At least four people have died in Assam over the last 24 hours, as the state still grapples with a flood that has barely shown signs of retreat over the past few days.According to sources in the state's disaster management authority, at least four people - one each in Dalgaon, Dibrugarh, Jagiroad and Barkhetri areas have lost their lives in past 24 hours.Over 16 lakh people have been affected and over 2.26 lakh of them are in relief camps. Around 50 people have died in Assam in over a month in the second wave of floods this year.Flood waters have completely ravaged over 2,000 villages and the Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger mark in six districts.About 1.45 lakh hectares of agricultural land is under flood waters. The Assam government has opened at least 300 relief camps across the state.One of the ill-fated villages is Naguchipathar in Barpeta district. People in the village have been moved to higher ground resorting to desperate measures such as rafts made of banana plant trunks.For 22-year-old Rajibul Ali, bracing massive floods is nothing new. But this time he is very worried. His first child was born only few days back when flood waters were gushing into his village."I was in Guwahati that day. I suddenly got to know the flood waters have rushed in. I have a newborn baby. You can understand what I went through," he told NDTV.Across the Brahmaputra valley, an alarming scale of destruction meets the eye. "For three months we are facing a series of floods. Children cannot go to school, there is hardly anything to eat, it has been a bitter battle for survival," says another flood victim Rupali Mondal.Farming and fisheries, the main livelihood of rural Assam, have been severely hit. The victims now face the risk of water-borne diseases.

<center><img src="G:\ \Project2\peace.jpg" alt="milz" width="400px" height="400px"></center>

NEW DELHI:  Acknowledging the role of previous governments in the peace process in Nagaland, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday hoped that the successful talks with the NSCN-IM will pave the way for development in the entire northeast.
"Every government tried doing something in this regard, some efforts succeeded, some did not. The process went on, and no government should take credit for it as every one of them contributed its bit and this resulted in successful talks with them (NSCN-IM)," he said while inaugurating the birth centenary celebrations of Naga leader Rani Gaidinliu."I hope the journey (with NSCN-IM and others), which has started, would give good results," he said.
PM Modi also expressed regret that many freedom fighters and prominent personalities who contributed to the cause of the country were not "remembered adequately".The prime minister said India must remember the glorious heritage of the freedom struggle and ensure that the legacy of the struggles and achievements of freedom fighters is passed on to succeeding generations."It is our misfortune that people such as Rani Gaidinliu have either not been remembered adequately, or have been deliberately forgotten," he said in his address.Ms Gaidinliu, affectionately called Rani Maa, believed that her struggle for the Naga people against the British was also a struggle for India's unity and integrity, he said.PM Modi also credited Ms Gaidinliu with spreading the message of Mahatma Gandhi in the northeast region.PM Modi said Ms Gaidinliu's thoughts on living in harmony with nature could provide an answer to the problem of climate change being faced by the world today.The prime minister also spoke of his government's initiatives for the development of the northeast.
He reiterated that the progress of the northeast will provide a big boost to the development of the entire nation.
"India will develop only if the northeast develops," PM Modi said, adding that the central government was committed to overall development of the region.
"We are putting in maximum efforts to build infrastructure in the northeast," he said.
The prime minister also said that following the resolution of the border dispute with Bangladesh, connectivity with the northeast was set to become easier. "The northeast has now become closer to the rest of India."Stating that the northeast was blessed with abundant natural bounty, he said the region has the potential to become the organic capital of the country.Coins of Rs.5 and Rs.100 were also released by the prime minister to mark the occasion. The Rs.5 coin will be circulated while the Rs.100 coin will be of commemorative nature.Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minster Arun Jaitley and Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Jitendra Singh also spoke on the occasion.Rajnath Singh said as Durgawati and Rani Laxmi Bai were mentioned in the history of the freedom struggle, the name of Ms Gaidinliu should have been given the same prominence."Historians have failed to do justice with Rani Gaidinliu," the home minister said, adding that the recent peace accord with the NSCN-IM takes forward her dream of securing peace and stability in the region.
Mr Jaitley said that remembering Ms Gaidinliu would help the northeast come closer to the mainstream.
"It would go a long way in creating a sense of involvement (among the people there)," he said, addressing the function largely attended by school children.
Jitendra Singh said Ms Gaidinliu was a symbol of the legacy and heritage of the northeast.
He also announced a fund of Rs.983.08 lakh for setting up a library-cum-museum at Kohima as a tribute to Gaidinliu.
Born on January 26, 1915, Rani Gaidinliu joined her cousin Haipou Jadonang's movement at the age of 13 to drive out the British from Manipur.
In 1932, she was arrested at the age of 16 and sentenced to life in prison.
She was released from Tura jail (now in Meghalaya) after having spent 14 years in various prisons.
She died on February 17, 1993, at Longkao in Manipur.Nagaland Governor PB Acharya, Nagaland Chief minister TR Zeliang, Manipur Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh and Tourism and Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma were also present on the occasion
