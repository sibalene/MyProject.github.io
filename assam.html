Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra Valley and the Barak Valley along with the Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts with an area of 30,285 square miles (78,440 km2). Assam is surrounded by six of the other Seven Sister States: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, and Meghalaya. Geographically Assam and these states are connected to the rest of India via a strip of land in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or "Chicken's Neck". Assam shares international border with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and culture, people and climate with South-East Asia – elements in India’s Look East policy.Assam became a part of British India after the British occupied the region following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–1826.
Assam tea is produced in the region of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Sivasagar. Petroleum is extracted in Digboi, Duliajan. The state is a major producer of Assam silk.
The state has conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds. It provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. Assam economy is aided by wildlife tourism while Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park are designated World Heritage Sites. Sal tree forests are found in the state, which as a result of rainfall looks green all year round. Assam receive more rainfall compared to most part of India.

<h2 style="color:red">CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
The people of Assam are a mixture of Mongolian, Indo-Burmese, Indo-Iranian and Aryan origin. This mixture of people constitutes the population of the state and they call themselves as ``Asomiya'' or ``Assamese'' and the language is also referred by the same. Among all the states of the country, Assam is said to have the largest number of tribes showing a great difference in their tradition, culture, dresses, and exotic way of life. Their culture and traditions along with their language is very unique for the outsiders as they really wonder about the Assamese of this north eastern state. Some of the major tribes of the Assamese are Boro (or Kachari), Karbi, Kosh-Rajbanshi, Miri, Mishimi and Rabha who show a variety in tradition, culture, dresses, and exotic way of life.

<h2 style="color:red">ORIGIN AND ETHINICITY</h2>
The language of Assamese is regarded as the lingua franca of the whole northeast India and its history is not been very clearly featured for there are records only dating from the 14th century. The tribes of the Mongolian origin mainly occupy the hilly areas of the state. It was the Ahom dynasty which ruled the area for more than 600 years without any interruption. The Mughal invaders tried to invade this hilly region for more than seventeen times but however it did not work. During this era, the Assamese society was exogenous. It was only in 1824 that the British entered the state for plantation of tea and that's when the destruction of the Ahom dynasty started. During the entry of the British into Assam, immigrants from different parts entered with varying traditional beliefs such as caste system and dowry system. Few of them who liked the place settled in Assam and formed their society strictly adhering to their original traditions.

<h2 style="color:red">CULTURE</h2>
The Assamese are noted for their mixed traditional culture because of the assimilation of various ethno-cultural groups in the past including the local elements and the local elements in Sanskritised forms can be seen. However the Assamese culture is greatly influenced by the Kamarupa Kingdom which had been grouped here for nearly 700 years. This was followed by the Ahom dynasty during the 13th century which reigned for more than 600 years. Another milestone in the culture of the Assamese were the Koch Kingdom (15th–16th century AD) of western Assam and Kachari Kingdom (12th–18th century AD) of central and southern Assam. During the 15th century the great Srimanta Sankardeva (Sonkordeu) and his disciples started a religio-cultural movement namely the Vaishanav Movement, which paved way for another dimension to Assamese culture.

The Assamese weddings, birth, festivals and even death include various customs and traditions which are supposed to be followed. The Assamese are very much attached to the bamboo culture, especially Jaapi which is more commonly known as the sunshade of Assam.
