<p style="text-indent:2cm;color:black;text-size:100%">Mizoram is one of the states of Northeast India, with Aizawl as its capital. The name is derived from Mi (people), Zo (Belonging to the people of Mizoram/Lushai Hills) and Ram (land), and thus Mizoram implies "land of the hill people". In the northeast, it is the southern most landlocked state sharing borders with three of the seven sister states, namely Tripura, Assam, Manipur. The state also shares a 722 kilometer border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory. It became the 23rd state of India, a step above Union Territory, on 20 February 1987.Mizoram's population was 1,091,014, according to 2011 census. It is the 2nd least populous state in the country.Mizoram covers an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometer.About 91% of the state is forested.
About 95% of current Mizoram population is of diverse tribal origins who settled in the state, mostly from southeast Asia, over waves of migration starting about 16th century but mainly in 18th century.This is the highest concentration of tribal people among all states of India, and they are currently protected under Indian constitution as Scheduled Tribe.The tribes converted from Animist religions to Christianity over the first half of 20th century. Mizoram is one of three states of India with a Christian majority (87%). Its people belong to various denominations, mostly Presbyterian in its north and Baptists in south.Mizoram is a highly literate agrarian economy, but suffers from slash-and-burn jhum or shifting cultivation, and poor crop yields. In recent years, the jhum farming practices are steadily being replaced with a significant horticulture and bamboo products industry. The state's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at 6991 crore (US$1.1 billion).About 20% of Mizoram's population lives below poverty line, with 35% rural poverty. The state has about 871 kilometers of national highways, with NH-54 and NH-150 connecting it to Assam and Manipur respectively. It is also a growing transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.</p>

<h2 style="color:red;">CULTURE IS THE ART OF LIVING</h2>
The people of Mizoram are popularly known as Mizos. The historical origin of the people of Mizoram is from the Mongolian race and distributed in the north- eastern part of the country centuries ago. During the 7th century these people had a temporary stay in Western Burma and China. Then in the 9th century at the time of the entry of the British Missionaries, the Mizos entered into India and got influenced by the Britishers and got themselves following Christianity. Various activities of the British Missionaries resulted in educating the people, influencing the Mizo language with Roman Script. It soon became a formal way of education. Kukis were the first set of Mizo people who migrated to India and was followed by the second batch of immigrants who were called New Kukis. During the ninth century under the influence of the British Missionaries the last set of Mizo people namely the Lushais came into the country and settled in the hilly area of Mizoram.
<h2 style="color:red;">ORIGIN AND ETHNICITY</h2>
The Mizo people are mostly Christians and scheduled tribes occupying Mizoram in majority. The Mizo history in the 18th and 19th Century is marked by several instances of tribal raids and retaliatory expeditions of security.

The Mizo people follow a special code of ethics namely Tlawmngaihna which always keep them in a close knitted society which keep them intact and characterized by features like honesty,helpful, soft-natured, sociable, considerate and loving each other.
The Kukish language owned by the Mizo people with various ethnic groups of people living in the north eastern part of India originated from western Burma (Myanmar) and eastern Bangladesh. Initially the union territory of Mizoram called as Lushai hills was under the geography of the state of Assam. Later this Union territory progressed into a full-fledged state. The earliest inhabitants of Mizoram were the Lusei people to have an external exposure and hence the ethnicity was initially known as the Lushai people. Though they fall under various clans like Paite, Lushei, Ralte, Gangte, Mara, Pawi, Himar, Pangs and Kukis, etc, they still call themselves as Mizo which came as a result of their demand and struggle in unity as Mizos for a separate political territory. Lusei Duhlian is the most common dialect used by the Mizo people and it belongs to Tibeto-Burman. The Mizo does also have a close knot to the Chins living in the state of Burma and to the Kukis. The ethnicity of the Mizo people are based on various factors like their different tribal groups, religions, rituals and festivals but still they all live in peace and harmony adhering to their old socio-cultural lineage.
