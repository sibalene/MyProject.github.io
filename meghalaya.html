The capital is Shillong, known as the "Scotland of the East". Meghalaya was previously part of Assam, but on 21 January 1972, the districts of Khasi, Garo and Jaintia hills became the new state of Meghalaya. English is the official language of Meghalaya. The other principal languages spoken include Khasi, Pnar and Garo. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has historically followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest daughter inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.The state is the wettest region of India, recording an average of 12,000 mm (470 in) of rains a year. About 70% of the state is forested.The Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion encompasses the state; its mountain forests are distinct from the lowland tropical forests to the north and south. The forests are notable for their biodiversity of mammals, birds, and plants.Meghalaya has predominantly an agrarian economy with a significant commercial forestry industry. The important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, spices, etc. The service sector is made up of real estate and insurance companies. Meghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at 16173 crore (US$2.4 billion) in current prices. The state is geologically rich in minerals, but it has no significant industries. The state has about 1,170 km (730 mi) of national highways. It is also a major logistical center for trade with Bangladesh.</p>

The people in Meghalaya have their forefathers as Mongoloids. It is this Mongloid community that has divided its society into two parts - patrilineal and matrilineal. The matrilineal society of Meghalaya consists of Garos, Khasis and Pnars. In these tribal communities, women have the freedom to work freely for themselves. Though they do not have a say in the community matters but they enjoy great respect in their respective families. 

The society within Meghalaya also do not allow customs where bride has to pay the price for getting marriage which in other words is also referred to as dowry. Women are held high for they give birth to the new generation. But since they have to fulfill all their household duties, the men are responsible for regulating the family. Hence the men makes most of the decisions for the family though they might consult with the women in the household. 

The society around Meghalaya has some special rules regarding inheritance of property. Among the Khasis, the maternal property always goes to the youngest daughter, while the rest of her sisters would be provided with some portions from it during their parents lifetime. While among the Garos, the children from birth belong to the mothers family. 

Even the law of inheritance in the Meghalaya society describes the status of men and women. When a tribal chief is to retire or he dies, he is to be followed by the eldest son of his eldest sister. But if she does not have any son, then the chief is followed by the eldest son of his next sister. Hence it shows that women are held very high in family but in social activities it is the men who takes over everything. 

<h2 style="color:red">People</h2>

Meghalaya people can be classified into three main groups i.e., Garos, Khasis, and Jaintias. The Garos inhabit in the western side of the Meghalaya, Khasis reside in the central region while Jaintias can be traced down in the eastern part of Meghalaya. The Khasi and Jaintia tribes have the traits of Proto Austroloid Monkhmer race whereas the Garos have come from Bodo family of the Tibeto-Burmar race. 

The Khasis along with the Pnars form a group named Khasi-Pnar. The Khasis can be traced down in the Khasi hills whereas Pnars are mainly located in Jaintia hills. Collectively, Jaintia, War, Khasi and Bhoi people are known as Hynniewtrep. 

Other than those mentioned above, there are many other tribes in Meghalaya. Two of them being the Bhoi and the War who reside generally in the southern and northern part of the central highland. Another tribe is Lyngams in the west of the Khasi and Jaintia hills. 

<h2 style="color:red">Demographics</h2>

Meghalaya demographics or population, as it commonly known, contains most of the tribal people housed within the territory of Meghalaya. Some of the important tribes that constitutes the demographics of Meghalaya are Garo, Khasi and Jaintia. 

Talking about the demographics in Meghalaya, it can be said that the population of Meghalaya< is unevenly distributed throughout the length and breadth of the state.

Some of the areas that hold the maximum population at Meghalaya are:
•	Area around Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. Places like Nongtoin, Tura, Baghmara, Williamnagar, Jowai, etc. rank high in terms of the density of population.
•	Areas around the Garo hills, especially the places around the northern, southern and the western fringes.
•	Cheerapunjee and Dawki.

The area encompassing the northern and southern part of the Khasi hills, some portions of the Jaintia hills and Garo hills are known for their sparse population in the demographics at Meghalaya. 

Meghalaya demographics shows two distinct divisions: tribal and non-tribal. Talking about the tribal population of Meghalaya, it can be said that the Khasis are the largest tribal group of Meghalaya. Khasis are followed by the Garos. Other tribes that form an important part of Meghalaya demographics are: Jaintias Koch Hajong Mikir Dimasa Lakhar Hmar Kuki, etc. Moreover, the demographics of Meghalaya show the presence of a lot Christians within the territory. In, fact, Meghalaya is said to be among the first three states of India, holding the maximum number of Christians. 

Thus, the Meghalaya demographics, as it is evident, is a crisp study on the living pattern of the people of Meghalaya. 

<h2 style="color:red">Religion</h2>

The Meghalaya religion is based on the fear and dread of the supernatural powers. Although, traditionally the religion of Meghalaya is not animistic; yet the religion in Meghalaya celebrates a presiding God, known as 'Dakgipa Rugipa Stugipa Pantugipa' or 'Tatora Rabuga Stura Pantura'. 

The religion at Meghalaya is basically monotheistic, yet has many polytheistic stages. In fact, the genesis of the religion shows that it was purely monotheistic; gradually it became polytheistic. 

Moreover, the Garos believe in the creation of the universe, earth, living beings, seas, heavenly bodies, rain, storm, thunder, wind- this constitute the essence of the religion in Meghalaya. Besides, the nature worship, the religion of Meghalaya also constitutes many lesser gods and many ceremonies and festivities are attached to it. 

In the recent years, most of the Garos have turned Christians. Yet, talking about the religion of the Garo clan in Meghalaya, it can be said that the religion is a combination of Hinduism and Pantheism. The Garos, like the Hindus and the Buddhists, believe in the 'Spirit of Man': this incarnation is based on sin. Some of the important deities of Meghalaya are Tartar-Robunga, Choradubi, Saljong, Goers, Susine, etc. 

Furthermore, sacrifices are a part of the religion in Meghalaya. The titular deities are invoked on many occasions in Meghalaya, such as birth, illness marriage, death, harvesting of crops, welfare of the community, protection from danger, etc. Like most of the Hindu religion, Meghalaya religion also shows reverence towards their ancestors. 

But, according to the generalization of many scholars and researchers, the religion of Meghalaya does not have a concrete base, as it is devoid of any logic. The nature worship or sacrificial rituals rank among the illogical human practices. Therefore, as it is evident, the religion of Meghalaya, basically the religion of the Garos, show a cultural patten, which is unlike any other religious practices of any other part pf India.
